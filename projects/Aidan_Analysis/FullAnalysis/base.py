# An experiment handles a group of mice that were trained in the same behaviour. It
# stores data and metadata for all included sessions belonging to the list of mice
# provided. The Experiment class is passed the mouse or list of mice, the class
# definition for the behaviour they were trained in (imported from pixels.behaviours),
# and the paths where it can find recording data (the folder containing 'raw', 'interim'
# and 'processed' folders) and training metadata.
